-------------------------------------
Added Exclusive and VPID hardware acceleration options to
Acceleration tab visible when $enableAdvancedConfig is set.

Added "Automatic" SATA Port Count option to the SATA Port Count

the VM Details section if $enableAdvancedConfig is set.

Fixed bug that would reload the list of VMs rather than refresh
the list when resetting a VM.

To ensure a more sane default setting, the remote display IP is
now determined in the following order:
	- consoleHost setting if set in config.php
	- IP address if set in VM's vrdeaddress setting
	- IP address / host specified of server's $location setting
		in config.php
	- If setting is 127.0.0.1 or localhost, use phpVirtualBox's IP
		address / hostname in its URL as determined by the web
		browser.

Fixed multi-server bug when initial server is unreachable.
http://code.google.com/p/phpvirtualbox/issues/detail?id=200

of a VM through NAT, remote display IP is now determined in the

GUI.

Some features of the Virtual Media Manager have been removed to
mimic the one in the VirtualBox GUI.

-------------------------------------
	4-2 - 2011-1-14
-------------------------------------
Viewing a VM's screenshot in a new window while running now
prints a descriptive error rather than displaying a blank
screen if the Oracle VM Extension Pack is not installed.

was because of a HUGE oversight on my part :) Which leads to
the next feature.

not installed.

Host network card and drive list is now properly refreshed when
refreshing host info via the Machine -> Refresh menu item.

Added MAC Address to Guest Network Adapters dialog.

displayed when PHP's default error reporting is set too high
in user's PHP config.

system properties cache as well.

preview thumbnail would stay in place as the window was
scrolled.

vm list pane to grow in width while a VM was loading in
certain browsers.

-------------------------------------
	4-1 - 2011-01-09
-------------------------------------
Changed behavior of file browser to always use config setting
for browserLocal regardless of browser's host. This should be
OK now that IVFSExplorer bugs are fixed in VirtualBox 4.0.

Fixed bug in Create HardDisk wizard functionality that would
only allow a disk of size 1MB to be created.

Fixed bug in display settings when the RDP extension pack is
not installed.

Fixed "Detach" console bug.

Disable Console tab when IE is detected. The Flash RDP client
from Oracle does not appear to work with IE. Even the demo
distributed with the flash control does not work. It appears
that RDPWebEventLoaded event is never triggered after the
flash control loads. -- Invalid - 2011-1-10

Max HD slider size in New HD wizard is now limited to 512GB.
Anything over that and the slider loses so much precision that
it becomes useless. You may still type a larger size in the
size text box. E.g. "1 TB"

-------------------------------------
	4-0 - 2011-01-07
-------------------------------------

-------------------------------------
Fixed some English translations.

Fixed OSE startup bug and removed console tab when OSE is

host server's details when it is selected in the list of vms.

Fixed bug in File -> Preferences that would not correctly
reflect a change made to any preferences on the General tab.

Workaround for Console tab resize bug that would disconnect from
an existing console session when the window was resized. Now, it
automatically reconnects after a window resize event.

Applied UI enhancements patch supplied by compuwizard123
http://code.google.com/u/compuwizard123/

Host details now include VirtualBox version.

-------------------------------------
		0.4 - 2010-07-24
-------------------------------------
Fixed numerous translation bugs.

Fixed bug that would not allow the addition of more than 4
storage controller types in VM Settings.

Changed WSDL cache to use memory only instead of both memory
and disk. (PHP SoapClient WSDL_CACHE_MEMORY option).

RDP host (for console tab and details tab RDP links) is now
selected in the following order:
	1) VM Configured host (would have to be set with VboxManage)
	2) rdpHost setting in config.php
	3) host in location setting of config.php
	*) if host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' use web browser
		location's URL host as last resort

Fixed bug in file / folder browser that would display the full
path of files / folders rather than just their names. This only
affected *nix web servers connecting to VirtualBox running on
Windows hosts. I can't imagine this is a very common scenario:)

Better error handling and meaningful error message when there
is a PHP error, and phpVirtualBox fails to load.

Fixed bug that would not allow you to enter your own internal
network name in VM network configurations where Attached To: is
set to Internal Network.

allow_call_time_pass_reference is set to Off in php.ini.

Removed ReflectionClass dependency. This also changes all
config options in config.php to use 'var' instead of 'const.'

License changed from GPL to MIT.

-------------------------------------
Fixed bug in file/folder browser that would incorrectly display
files as folders and folders as files in some cases.

Added Console tab.

Added OSE support. This effectively removes the console tab,
USB, and VRDP support when OSE is detected.

Fixed bug in Host-networking interfaces pane that would cause
tabs to disappear if editing a host interface more than once
without refreshing.

Made VM list and main tab content scrollable.

Added Guest Network Adapter info. This queries guest additions
for network adapter IP information of a running VM.

Added Clone, Make Immutable, and Make Normal functionality to
Virtual Media Manager.

Fixed bug in Virtual Media Manager that would allow a user to
try to release a medium that is attached to a snapshot. This
attempt would always fail.

Fixed bug that would cause saving USB filters to fail.

Added Import / Export Appliance. NOTE: Some configurable
import settings are ignored (e.g. network interface type).
These are also ignored when importing from the VirtualBox
GUI, and so appears to be a bug in VirtualBox itself.

Added file type icons to file / folder browser.

Fixed internal network dropdown list in Virtual Machine
settings.
