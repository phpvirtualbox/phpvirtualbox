# About

April 2025

Project adopted by Anonie Muss. Updated from https://github.com/studnitskiy/phpvirtualbox where
it had been modified to work with VirtualBox 7.1. Thanks to studnitskiy for his work, and now that
he is a member of the github project, I hope he will continue to contribute.

## Roadmap

- [ ] ~~Use Guacamole instead of Flash RDP client~~ Not possible without some gateway server
- [ ] Ensure feature parity with VirtualBox 7.1 minus Oracle Cloud features
- [x] PHP 8.4 compatibility
- [x] jQuery and jQuery UI updates
- [ ] Create a release process where javascript and CSS are minified and releses do not contain unnecessary build artifacts
- [ ] UI parity with VirtualBox 7.1 minus Oracle Cloud features

## History

October 2024

VirtualBox 7.1 support for x86 hosts only, no ARM hosts support.
I've basically made it stop complaining and allow my existing environment to work.
Minimally tested with PHP 8.2 (PHP-FPM + nginx).
